# TechniSound
A computer music system to read, play, and edit music

## Goals
- Recognize sheet music images and process into a sequence of notes
- Play sequence of notes as pure frequency sound waves. Eventually add more realistic sounding notes to resemble actual instruments
- Implement various filters and music editing methods

## To Do
- [ ] develop tools for 'listening' to various functions, sequences, plots
- [ ] invert tunes to plots, images, functions...
- [ ] create different 'instruments' (see [OEIS](https://oeis.org/play?seq=A000045) for potential examples)
- [ ] Write tests for reading in sheet music
- [ ] Machine learning to recognize notes in sheet music
- [ ] add a read the docs and tutorials for CLI
