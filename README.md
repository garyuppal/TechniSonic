# TechniSound
A computer music system to read, play, and edit music

## Goals
- Recognize sheet music images and process into a sequence of notes
- Play sequence of notes as pure frequency sound waves. Eventually add more realistic sounding notes to resemble actual instruments
- Implement various filters and music editing methods
